    "**Introduction:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In this data science portfolio project, our focus is on monitoring the stability of a credit scoring model using **PySpark, Python, and SQL**. The model generates a credit score, specifically the \"Estimated Probability of Default,\" for customers based on categorical and continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively evaluate the model's stability, we will use two crucial metrics: **PSI (Population Stability Index)** and **VDI (Variable Deviation Index)**. These metrics will allow us to conduct a comparative analysis between the baseline scoring table from January 2023 and the validation scoring table from February 2023.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Description:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used in this project consists of two tables: the baseline scoring table and the validation scoring table, derived from a credit scoring model. These tables contain information for January 2023 and February 2023, respectively. Each month consists of data for 100 customers. The variables included in these tables are a mix of categorical and continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical variables:\n",
    "1. \"Grade\" - Represents the credit grade or rating assigned to the customers.\n",
    "2. \"BINS_Utilization_at_Bureau\" - Indicates the credit utilization ratio at the credit bureau.\n",
    "3. \"Region\" - Refers to the geographical region of the customers.\n",
    "4. \"BINS_Inquiries_at_the_credit_bureau_last_6months\" - Tracks the number of inquiries made at the credit bureau in the last 6 months.\n",
    "5. \"BINS_Other_Score\" - Represents another credit score associated with the customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous variables:\n",
    "1. \"Age\" - Represents the age of the customers.\n",
    "2. \"Delinquency\" - Indicates any past delinquency or missed payments.\n",
    "3. \"Time_at_Residence\" - Represents the duration of time the customers have lived at their current residence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The credit scoring model utilizes these variables to generate the \"Estimated Probability of Default,\" which serves as an estimate of the likelihood of a customer defaulting on their credit obligations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Goals:**\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to assess the stability of the credit scoring model over time. We aim to identify any significant shifts or inconsistencies in the population distribution of the \"Estimated Probability of Default\" between the baseline and validation months. To achieve this, we will employ the **Population Stability Index (PSI)** and the **Variable Deviation Index (VDI)** metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Data Science Techniques:**\n",
    "\n",
    "To accomplish the project goals, we will utilize a combination of PySpark, Python, and SQL. PySpark will help us efficiently handle and process large-scale data. Python will be used for data analysis, visualization, and model evaluation. SQL will come in handy for querying and manipulating the data in the baseline and validation scoring tables.\n",
    "Through this data science project, we aim to demonstrate the importance of model stability evaluation and showcase the effective combination of these tools for practical data analysis and monitoring tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Conclusions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Please refer to the end of the project for detailed conclusions."

    "**Population Stability Index (PSI)** is a metric used to assess the stability of a population or distribution over time. It is commonly employed in the fields of statistics and data analytics. PSI measures the degree of change in the proportion or composition of a population between two time periods or datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, PSI helps to answer the question: \"How different is the current population (baseline) from the reference population (validation)?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The main purpose of PSI is to identify significant shifts or changes in the distribution of data, which can be crucial for various applications, such as monitoring model performance, detecting data drift, or evaluating the impact of changes in a business process or environment. **Data drift**, which refers to changes in the distribution of data over time or between datasets, can be detected using PSI. If there is a considerable PSI value between the baseline and validation datasets, it indicates that the data has drifted, and the model's performance may be affected.\n",
    "\n",
    "*It's worth noting that PSI uses fixed estimated probability bounds from the baseline dataset, which remain constant throughout the analysis. This ensures that the comparison between the baseline and validation datasets is consistent and reliable over time.*\n",
    "\n",
    "By comparing the proportions of groups or segments between two periods, analysts can assess if the changes are within an acceptable range or if further investigation is needed to understand the reasons behind the shifts and potential data drift. Monitoring PSI regularly helps data scientists and analysts maintain the reliability and accuracy of their models in dynamic environments where data distributions may change over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the given code, we are computing the Population Stability Index (PSI) using **Common Table Expressions (CTE) in SQL** , **Python** and **Pyspark**. This analysis is part of a credit scoring model project, where we are scoring customers for January 2023 (considered as the baseline scoring table) and customers for February 2023 (considered as the validation scoring table).\n",
    "\n",
    "Firstly, we identify the field that represents the Estimated Probability of Default, which we'll refer to as ESTIMATED_PROBABILITY_FIELD. Using this field, we generate bins to group the data, and for this calculation, we have set the number of bins to be used as PSI_N_BINS (10 bins, in this case).\n",
    "\n",
    "The result of this analysis is presented as a **\"system stability report\"** which provides valuable insights into how stable the model is between the baseline and validation periods. This report helps us understand if there have been significant changes in the model's performance or data distribution over time."

    "If the PSI (Population Stability Index) deteriorates, it could indicate significant changes in the data distribution between the baseline and validation datasets. These changes may be related to specific variables in the model, which could affect the **VDI (Variable Deviation Index)** for those particular variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify which variables are contributing to the PSI deterioration, it is important to review each variable individually using the VDI. If a variable shows a significant deterioration in its VDI, it suggests that there have been significant changes in its distribution between the baseline and validation datasets.\n",

    "The **Variable Deviation Index (VDI)** is a metric used to assess the stability of individual variables in a model or dataset. It complements the Population Stability Index (PSI) by focusing on the changes in the distribution of specific variables over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In simple terms, VDI helps answer the question: \"How much have the individual variables changed between the baseline and validation datasets?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "While PSI evaluates the overall population stability, VDI looks at the changes in individual variables. It measures the degree of deviation or shift in the distribution of each variable between the two time periods or datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Unlike PSI, VDI is not based on fixed probability bounds but rather on the categories of the variable itself. It calculates the contribution of each category to the overall deviation, allowing data scientists and analysts to identify which specific categories within the variable have experienced significant changes.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like PSI, VDI is also valuable in detecting **data drift**, as it highlights which variables have experienced significant changes. By analyzing VDI for each variable, data scientists and analysts can pinpoint the factors contributing to population instability.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the credit scoring model project described in the code, VDI can help identify specific variables that have contributed to the PSI changes observed in the system stability report. It can be a crucial step in understanding the root causes of any performance variations and guide further investigation and potential model adjustments.\n",
    "\n",

    "In the given code, we are computing the Variable Deviation Index (VDI) for a categorical variable using **Common Table Expressions (CTE) in SQL, Python, and Pyspark**. This analysis is part of a credit scoring model project, specifically focusing on the \"Grade\" variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of VDI is to measure the degree of deviation or changes in the distribution of the \"Grade\" variable between the baseline and validation datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate VDI, we start by creating two separate datasets - one for the baseline period (January 2023) and another for the validation period (February 2023). Then, we count the occurrences of each category within the \"Grade\" variable for both datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we calculate the proportions of each category in both periods to understand how the distribution has changed. The VDI value is computed by comparing the proportions between the baseline and validation datasets, and a higher VDI indicates more significant changes in the distribution of the \"Grade\" variable.\n",

    "The result of this analysis is presented as the \"Variable Deviation Index\" (VDI) in the **scorecard characteristic\n",

    "\n",
    "By monitoring VDI regularly for different categorical variables, data scientists and analysts can detect any shifts or instabilities in the model's predictions, allowing them to take appropriate actions to maintain model accuracy and reliability."

    "In the provided code, we are calculating the Variable Deviation Index (VDI) for a continuous variable using Common Table Expressions (CTE) in SQL, Python, and Pyspark. This analysis focuses on the \"Age\" variable and is part of a credit scoring model project. The objective is to score customers for January 2023, which serves as the baseline scoring table, and customers for February 2023, which represents the validation scoring table.\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of VDI is to measure the degree of deviation or changes in the distribution of the \"Age\" variable between the baseline and validation datasets. Unlike categorical variables, continuous variables like \"Age\" have a range of values, and VDI helps us understand how this range has changed over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We divide the continuous values of the \"Age\" variable into a specified number of bins (VDI_N_BINS), which helps group similar values together for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we calculate the proportion of observations in each bin for both baseline and validation datasets. The VDI value is computed by comparing the proportions between the baseline and validation datasets. A higher VDI indicates more significant changes in the distribution of the \"Age\" variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's important to highlight that the calculation of PSI and VDI for continuous variables is the same. Both metrics, PSI and VDI, utilize fixed maximum and minimum values for each age bin from the baseline dataset. These bounds remain constant throughout the analysis, ensuring a consistent and dependable comparison between the baseline and validation datasets over time. This level of consistency is essential for precisely measuring the stability and changes in the distribution of continuous variables, such as \"Age,\" in the credit scoring model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The results of this analysis are presented as the \"Variable Deviation Index\" (VDI) in the \"scorecard characteristic analysis.\" This valuable analysis provides insights into how the distribution of the \"Age\" variable has evolved over time, contributing to a better understanding of the model's performance and potential data drift in the credit scoring model.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this analysis, we select the continuous variable \"Age\" for examination, which we'll refer to as CONTINUOUS_VARIABLE. Using this field, we create bins to group the data, and for this calculation, we have chosen to use VDI_N_BINS (10 bins in this case)."

To achieve this, we begin by creating a list that includes the continuous variables we wish to analyze. The variables in question are: \"Age\", \"Delinquency\", and \"Time_at_Residence\". By iterating the VDI calculation over each of these variables, we can gain valuable insights into how the distribution of each continuous variable has evolved over time, contributing to a comprehensive understanding of the credit scoring model's performance and potential data drift."

    "In this data science portfolio project, we focused on monitoring the stability of a credit scoring model using PySpark, Python, and SQL. The model generated a credit score, specifically the \"Estimated Probability of Default,\" for customers based on categorical and continuous variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "To effectively evaluate the model's stability, we utilized two crucial metrics, PSI (Population Stability Index) and VDI (Variable Deviation Index). The PSI value of 0.1081 indicated a significant shift in the distribution between the baseline and validation datasets, prompting the need for further investigation to ensure the model's reliability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Among the variables, \"BINS_Inquiries_at_the_credit_bureau_last_6months\" exhibited a notable shift, warranting in-depth examination before inclusion in the model. Meanwhile, \"BINS_Utilization_at_Bureau,\" \"Grade,\" \"BINS_Other_Score,\" and \"Region\" demonstrated stability with minimal changes, making them suitable for the credit scoring model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the \"Age\" variable revealed a significant shift, requiring careful consideration, along with \"Time_at_Residence,\" which showed moderate changes. Conversely, \"Delinquency\" displayed a minor shift and remains consistent as a viable variable for the model.\n",

    "These findings highlight the significance of careful analysis and choosing stable variables to create an accurate and dependable credit scoring model, demonstrating the effectiveness of PySpark, Python, and SQL in data science projects."
